# Surface_Engergy_budget_in_the_Mixed_Layer
This toolbox contains the functions and an example (inputs and outputs) to run “seml” (Surface_Engergy_budget_in_the_Mixed_Lake), a code that computes surface energy budgets, lake numbers, and stability. 
Please, always keep in mind that this code is a ‘research’ code, and thus is always under development.
